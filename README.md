`Dockerfile` to create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container image for [Redis](http://redis.io/).

Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs.
